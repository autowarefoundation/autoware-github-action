# sync-files

## Description

This action syncs files between repositories.  
It uses [peter-evans/create-pull-request](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/) for creating pull requests and [peter-evans/enable-pull-request-automerge](https://github.com/peter-evans/enable-pull-request-automerge) for enabling auto-merge.

Note that you need `workflow` permission for the token if you copy workflow files of GitHub Actions.
